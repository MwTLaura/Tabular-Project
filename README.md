# **ðŸ“Š Predicting Digital Wellbeing Score from Behavioral and Mental Health Data**

This repository presents a complete machine learning pipeline to predict an individualâ€™s digital wellbeing score using real-world behavioral and mental health data collected between 2020 and 2024. It includes data cleaning, outlier handling, feature scaling, exploratory analysis, and the implementation of multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) to evaluate performance. The project demonstrates that digital wellbeing can be accurately estimated from features like screen time, social media usage, mood, anxiety, and sleep, achieving an RMSE of 0.59 and an RÂ² of 0.99 with a simple linear model.

Dataset used: Mental Health and Digital Behavior 2020â€“2024 on Kaggle
